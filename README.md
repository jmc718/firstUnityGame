# Overview

This is my first time working in Unity. After the difficulties of working with ThreeJS, I was a little intimidated at first. Working with Unity has been a blast though. It's been a dream of mine for a long time to make a 3D game and though this is far from a finished product, I've done more than I thought I'd be able to already.

Here's a video of how the software functions.
